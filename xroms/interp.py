    This function uses `xroms.utilities.xisoslice` to calculate slices of depth. 
    Delaunay triangulation is used to find horizontal locations in grid space from 
    input lon/lat coordinates. The interpolation in eta/xi space is done through 
    xarray's `interp`. Time interpolation can easily be done after running this

    trisgrid: previously-calculated output from setup function, already subsetted to whichgrid

    z0s (None): vertical depths to interpolate to. Shape does not need to match lon0/lat0 since
      unless `triplets=True` is also input, values will be calculated for lon0/lat0 for every 
      value in z0s.
    zetaconstant (False): Input as True to not consider time-varying zeta for depth-interpolation.
    triplets (False): If True, input arrays must be the same shapes and 1D
      and assumed that the inputs are triplets for interpolation.
      Otherwise, only lon0/lat0 need to match shape and they will be found for all 
      input z0s values.
